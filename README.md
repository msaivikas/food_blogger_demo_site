# foodblogger-template

This is a template for food bloggers. 
You can put your own text and images in place of dummy portions for your personal foodblogging website.
The options that work in the navigation bar: 'Recipes', 'snacks' and 'cakes' under the dropdown menu 'Bakery'.
You can visit the demo website here, https://food-blogger-demo-site.pages.dev/
